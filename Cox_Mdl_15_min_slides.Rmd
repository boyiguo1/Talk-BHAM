## Additive Cox Proportional Hazards Model

Following all necessary assumptions, a Cox proportional hazards model with event time $t_i$ and predictors $x_{ij}, j = 1, \dots, p$, is expressed as
$$
h(t_i) = h_0(t_i)\exp(\sum\limits^p_{j=1}B_j(x_{ij})) , \quad i = 1, \dots, n.
$$

* Spline functions
$$
B(x) = \sum\limits_{k = 1}^K \beta_k b_k(x) \equiv  \bs X^T \bs \beta
$$
  
$b_k(x)$ are the _basis functions_, possibly truncated power basis and b-spline basis. [@Wood2017] 

<!-- A _spline_ function is a piece-wise polynomial function -->

## Function Smoothing

* Smoothing penalty $\text{pen}_\lambda(B_j(X_j)) = \lambda \int B^{''}(X)^2dx = \lambda \bs \beta^T \bs S \bs\beta$
  * The smoothing penalty matrix $\bs S$ is known given $\bs X$
  * $\bs S$ is symmetric and positive semi-definite

* Penalized Partial Likelihood Function
$$
pl(\bs \beta) = \sum\limits^n_{i=1}d_i\log\frac{\exp{(\bs \beta^T\bs x_i )}}{\sum_{{i^\prime} \in R(t_i)} \exp(\bs \beta^T bs x_{i^\prime})} - \sum\limits_{j=1}^p \text{pen}_\lambda(B_j(X_j)),
$$
    
  * The smoothing parameter $\lambda$ is a tuning parameter, selected via cross-validation
 
 
## High-dimensional Additive Cox Model

Primary Challenges:

* Jointly model signal sparsity versus function smoothness
  * Smooth penalty only overfits the model
  * Sparsity penalty only overshinks the coefficients
  * Damage predictive performance
* Adaptive shrinkage
  * Global shrinkage assumes similar function smoothness
* Bi-level selection that simultaneously answers
  * if a variable is predictive to the outcome, $B_j(X_j) = 0$
  * if a variable has a nonlinear relationship with the outcome, $B_j(X_j) = \beta_j X_j$

# Bayesian Hierarchical Additive Model

* Two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior for spline functions
  * Variable selection via inclusion indicator
  * Bi-level selection accounting for effect hierarchy
  * Adaptive shrinkage via Bayesian regularization

* EM-Coordinate Descent algorithm
  * Expedited computation
  * Seamless variable selection via sparse solution


## Two-part Spike-and-slab LASSO (SSL) Prior

Follow @Marra2011, a spline function $B(X) = \bm X^T \bm \beta$ can be decomposed to linear and nonlinear components with respect to the smoothing penalty matrix $S$
$$\bm X^T \bm \beta = X^{0} \beta + \bs X^\tp \bs \beta^\tp$$
   
Two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior
\begin{align*}
\beta_{j} |\gamma_{j},s_0,s_1 &\sim DE(0,(1-\gamma_{j}) s_0 + \gamma_{j} s_1) \\
\beta^\tp_{jk} | \gamma^\tp_{j},s_0,s_1 &\simiid DE(0,(1-\gamma^\tp_{j}) s_0 + \gamma^\tp_{j} s_1), k = 1, \dots, K-1
\end{align*}

  * $\gamma_{j}$ controls the inclusion of linear component
  * $\gamma_{j}^\tp$ controls the inclusion of nonlinear component


## Effect Hierarchy and Adaptive Shrinkage

_Effect hierarchy_ assumes lower-order effects are more likely to be active than higher-order effects

* Structured prior on latent indicators $\gamma_j$ and $\gamma^\tp_{j}$
$$
\gamma_{j} | \theta_j \sim Bin(\gamma_{j}|1, \theta_j),\quad
\gamma_{j}^\tp | \gamma_{j}, \theta_j \sim Bin(1, \gamma_{j}\theta_j),
$$
  * Simplification via analytic integration
  $$
  \gamma_{j}^\tp | \theta_j \sim Bin(1, \theta_j^2),
  $$

* Adaptive shrinkage
$$
\theta_j \sim \text{Beta}(a,b)
$$

## EM-Cooridante Descent Algrithm

We are interested in estimating $\Theta = \{\bm \beta, \bm \theta\}$ using optimization based algorithm for scalability purpose

  * Treat $\gamma$s as the "missing data" in the EM procedure
    * Construct the conditional expectation of the posterior density function
  * Decompose the posterior density function to two pieces
    * $L_1$ penalized partial likelihood function of $\beta$
    * Posterior density function of $\theta$
  * Maximize the two pieces independently
    * Optimize $\beta$ with coordinate descent algorithm
    * Optimize $\theta$ with beta-binomial conjugate relationship

# Numeric Studies
## Simulation Study
* $n_{train} = 500$, $n_{test}=1000$
* $p=4, 10, 50, 100, 200$
* Survival and censoring time follow Weibull distribution
  * Censoring rate is controlled at \{0.15, 0.3, 0.45\}
