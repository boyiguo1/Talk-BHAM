# High Dimensional Generalized Additive Model

* Models that can handle grouped predictors
  * Penalized model with grouped penalty: Lasso, SCAD
  * Bayesian regularized models with grouped prior: spike-and-slab prior

* Overly shrinking due to sparse penalty

* Reduced interpretation due to the "all-in-all-out" functional selection 

* Lack of uncertainty measure for penalized models

* Scaling problem for Bayesian regularized models

# Bayesian Hierarchical Additive Model
* Re-parameterization of smoothing function design matrix
  * Eigen-decompose the smoothing penalty matrix of a smoothing function
  * Deploy smoothing penalty on the smoothing function
  * Isolate the linear and polynomial spaces of a smoothing function
  
* Two-part spike-and-slab lasso prior
  * Independent SS-Lasso priors on linear and polynomial spaces
  * Two latent indicator variables for bi-level selection
  * Hyperpior of latent indicator variables for local adaptation

# Optimization Algorithms

* EM algorithms 
* Combine with coordinate descent algorithm for fast computing and sparse solution
* Combine with iterative weighted least square for uncertainty measures
  * Accommodate other priors: Bayesian ridge, lasso priors, spike-and-slab priors

# Software Support

* R package: \texttt{BHAM}
  - Ancillary functions for setting up high-dimensional spline formulation
  - Model summary, variable selection, and curve plotting
  - Covariate adjustment without penalty
